              <p>Dune is a 1965 science fiction novel by American author Frank Herbert, originally published as two separate serials in Analog magazine. It is the first installment of the Dune saga; in 2003, it was cited as the world's best-selling science fiction novel. Herbert wrote five sequels: Dune Messiah, Children of Dune, God Emperor of Dune, Heretics of Dune, and Chapterhouse: Dune.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
              <p>Dune is set in the distant future amidst a feudal interstellar society in which various noble houses control planetary fiefs. It tells the story of young Paul Atreides, whose family accepts the stewardship of the planet Arrakis. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or "the spice," a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. Melange is also necessary for space navigation, which requires a kind of multidimensional awareness and foresight that only the drug provides. As melange can only be produced on Arrakis, control of the planet is thus a coveted and dangerous undertaking. The story explores the multi-layered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology, and human emotion, as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.</p>

                <p>After the novel's initial success, attempts to adapt Dune as a film began in 1971. A lengthy process of development followed throughout the 1970s, during which Arthur P. Jacobs, Alejandro Jodorowsky, and Ridley Scott unsuccessfully tried to bring their visions to the screen. In 1981, executive producer Dino De Laurentiis hired Lynch as director. The film was released in 1984. It was a box office bomb, grossing $30.9 million from a $40 million budget, and was negatively reviewed by critics, who heavily criticized the screenwriting, lack of faithfulness to the source material, pacing, direction, and editing, although the visual effects, musical score, acting, and action sequences were praised.

                The newest film adaptation of Dune, produced by Legendary Pictures was scheduled to release in 2020, but due to Covid-19, has been pushed back to October 2021. The movie will adapt the first half of the first of Frank Herbert's "Dune" novels. It's directed by Denis Villeneuve, who has already proved himself with the mind-blowing sequel "Blade Runner 2049" — which is nothing short of epic — together with "Arrival" and "Sicarrio," which are both also phenomenal motion pictures.
